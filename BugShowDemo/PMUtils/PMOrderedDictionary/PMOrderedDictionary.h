 *  Raises an NSInvalidArgumentException if anObject is nil. If you need to represent a nil value in the dictionary, use NSNull.
 *  @param aKey     The key for value. The key is copied (using copyWithZone:; keys must conform to the NSCopying protocol). 
 *  Raises an NSInvalidArgumentException if aKey is nil. If aKey already exists in the dictionary, the previously associated value is removed and anObject
 *  is added at anIndex.
 *  @param anIndex  The index to add the key-value pair in the dictionary.
